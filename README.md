In this museum web-app, I’ve used HTML5, BEM, CSS/SCSS, sass preprocessors.
For VSCode, I’ve used a particular scope of IDE extensions, such as style and formatting lints, and I tend to use them as I think it’s a part of good coding practice.

BEM - block element modifier methodology. It helps you to structure you html code, help you with modularity and flexibility while working with css.
For example, you have few common css selectors with common naming, you could bring some structure to that mess by introducing one single parent class with BEM syntax.
The concept of reusing is somewhat similar to React components in terms of reusability.
